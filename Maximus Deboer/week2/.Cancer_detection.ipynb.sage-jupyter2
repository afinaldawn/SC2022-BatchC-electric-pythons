Splitting our data into training and testing sets. You can watch a video on why we do that [in the first 36 seconds of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vdMKioCXqQ). \n\nWe will split our data using the [`train_test_split()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function on `sklearn` using the same flow as this tutorial: https://realpython.com/train-test-split-python-data/#application-of-train_test_split.
